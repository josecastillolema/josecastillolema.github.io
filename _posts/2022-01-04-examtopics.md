I have been using the mocks from [ExamTopics](https://www.examtopics.com/) latelly to prepare to several certification exams and I have to say I found them the best material around.

I personally prefer them over exam reviews/practice tests from paid platforms, for the following reasons:
 - the community around
 - free
 - comments for questions: I learn a lot reading the discussion forum for each question
 - updated: I found the questions from ExamTopics to be always relevant and updated, as you can infere from the comments

At the moment of this writing, they have:
 - 109 certification providers
 - 1292 exams
 - 126 average daily updates
 - 2089 online users

I believe in certification as a tool to make a positive change, and I hope the ExamTopics community stays relevant and grows over time.
