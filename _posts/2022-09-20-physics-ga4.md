The **4th PHYSICS project General Assembly** meeting was held July 4-6, 2022, hosted by [RYAX](https://ryax.tech/) in Athens, Greece. During the meeting, partners analyzed the project’s growth and had the opportunity to participate in person or virtually in discussions about the next goals of the project. All the work packages of the project were discussed in-depth to monitor the project’s progress and agree on plans for the future.

[**PHYSICS**](/physics/) (**oPtimized HYbrid Space-time servIce Continuum in faaS**) is a research project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101017047. The project began in January 2021 with 14 international partners and is scheduled to end in December 2023. Partners include Red Hat, Atos, RYAX, the Polytechnic University of Madrid (Spain), and Harokopio University (Greece).

The project’s goal is to enable application developers to design, implement, and deploy advanced function-as-a-service (FaaS) applications in the scope of advanced cloud application design environments by leveraging proven design patterns and existing libraries of cloud/FaaS components.

Red Hat engineers lead the work package **Extended Infrastructure Services with Adaptable Algorithms**, where they leverage several community projects to support PHYSICS’s multi-cluster orchestration and connectivity requirements. Some of the projects modified for PHYSICS’ purposes are [Submariner](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner) and [MicroShift](https://github.com/openshift/microshift). Other projects used include Node-RED and Apache OpenWhisk.
