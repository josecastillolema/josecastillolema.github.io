## Sessions

I will be speaking at [Open vSwitch and OVN 2025 Fall Conference](https://www.openvswitch.org/support/ovscon2025/) in Prague on June 12-14. The [Open vSwitch project](https://www.openvswitch.org/), a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project, will host its eleventh annual conference focused on Open vSwitch and OVN on November 19 - 20, 2025. The conference will be hybrid. Talks will be presented live during the conference. We are planning to use an online system that allows for text-based discussion, and live Q&A while the talk is happening for virtual attendees. Each talk will have time reserved following the presentation for further discussion via both text, over video and audio, and live with the presenters. Each talk will be given once.

Here are my sessions:

 - **AI-Powered Performance Insights: Integrating OVS/OVN automatic performance regression analysis with LLMs** - with Joe Talerico and Raul Sevilla
