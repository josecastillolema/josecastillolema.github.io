## AWS Community Builders program
[![](/assets/images/posts/2021-05-15-aws-community-builder.png)](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/)

I am glad to be part of the [AWS Community Builders program](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/). The program offers technical resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities to AWS enthusiasts and emerging thought leaders who are passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with the technical community.

Throughout the program, subject matter experts will provide mentorship and share insights, including information about the latest services, as well as best practices for creating technical content, increasing reach, and sharing AWS knowledge across online and in-person communities. The program will accept a limited number of members per year. All AWS builders are welcome and encouraged to apply.

Program members are expected to participate in mentorship opportunities, continue to share or produce educational and technical content, actively engage with and help build the AWS community, and demonstrate continued interest in learning more about AWS.

The AWS Community Builders Directory can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=cb-type%23containers&awsf.location=location%23latam&awsf.year=*all).
