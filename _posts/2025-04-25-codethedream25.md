[Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/) thanks Jos√© Castillo Lema of Red Hat for being our featured employer speaker for this week's Skill-IT üç≥!

Last month, Jos√© helped our students and apprentices through an intro to Docker, an open-source tool for building and managing containerized applications. Today, Jos√© followed up by guiding participants through hands-on practice with Docker. We're grateful to Jos√© and Red Hat for being valuable partners in our work!

Skill-IT üç≥is a weekly lunch-and-learn workshop for Code the Dream students and apprentices to explore career topics, programs, and organizations. Our goal is to help participants make informed decisions and navigate the tech industry as they launch their careers.

Interested in being a featured employer speaker for a future Skill-IT üç≥? Contact our Director of Employer Partnerships, [Rosalyn H. Barnett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosalyn-hundley/), at [rosalyn@codethedream.org](mailto:rosalyn@codethedream.org) to learn more and get scheduled!
