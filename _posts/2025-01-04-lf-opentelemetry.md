[Linux Foundation Training & Certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/) provides free online-learning courses on a range of open source topics from Linux to blockchain, networking to cloud, and everything in between, with the possibility of earning certificates and badges.

I would like to recommend the [Getting Started with OpenTelemetry](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/getting-started-with-opentelemetry-lfs148/) course to learn how to use [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to build and manage unified observability.

# LFS148

Earners of the **LSF148: Getting Started with OpenTelemetry** badge have hands-on experience implementing observability in software applications using OpenTelemetry. They can instrument Python and Java applications for traces, metrics, and logs, using both automatic and manual techniques. They understand telemetry signals, can use OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs, and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to export data to backends like Jaeger and Prometheus.
