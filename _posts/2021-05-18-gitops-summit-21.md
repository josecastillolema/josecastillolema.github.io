## Virtual Experience

**June 22, 2021**

**#GitOpsSummit**

Cloud native technologies enable organizations to scale rapidly and deliver software faster than ever before. GitOps, operation by pull request, is a powerful developer workflow that enables organizations to unlock the promise of cloud native continuous delivery. The GitOps Summit brings together topflight talent to give you a greater understanding of GitOps, share insights into the evolving tools landscape and help you figure out the best approach for adopting GitOps.

Scaling from 2 deployments a day to 200, rapid cluster recovery, complete audit trails â€“ these are some of the benefits shared by teams who adopt a GitOps approach. An emerging paradigm, GitOps teams also need to understand secrets management, scaling challenges and how to tackle adopting best practices. Join us at the GitOps Summit to learn more in this 1-day deep dive.

The GitOps Summit is hosted by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)](https://cd.foundation/) and the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) and will be co-located with [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/).
