[Linux Foundation Training & Certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/) provides free online-learning courses on a range of open source topics from Linux to blockchain, networking to cloud, and everything in between, with the possibility of earning certificates and badges.

I would like to recommend the [Introduction to Backstage - Developer Portals Made Easy](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/introduction-to-backstage-developer-portals-made-easy-lfs142) course to learn how developer portals like [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) can help teams reduce tech fragmentation, knowledge silos, and lack of ownership while promoting creativity and autonomy.

# LFS142

Earners of the **LFS142: Introduction to Backstage - Developer Portals Made Easy** badge have learned to use the Backstage framework to advocate for and implement developer portals that enhance productivity and creativity within organizations. They can explain Backstageâ€™s architecture, features, and setup processes, tailor Backstage to meet specific organizational needs, and customize it with plugins. They know how to deploy a developer portal that fosters autonomy and reduces technical silos.
