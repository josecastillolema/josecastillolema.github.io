**8th Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing Performance (HotCloudPerf 2025)**

[![](/assets/images/posts/2025-05-06-hotcloudperf25/1.png)](https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/)

## [Agenda](https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/)

## Overview

The [HotCloudPerf](https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/) workshop proposes a meeting venue for academics and practitioners, from experts to trainees, in the field of cloud computing performance. The new understanding of cloud computing covers the full computational continuum from data centers to edge resources to IoT sensors and devices. The workshop aims to engage this community and to lead to the development of new methodological aspects for gaining a deeper understanding not only of cloud performance, but also of cloud operation and behavior, through diverse quantitative evaluation tools, including benchmarks, metrics, and workload generators. The workshop focuses on novel cloud properties such as elasticity, performance isolation, dependability, and other non-functional system properties, in addition to classical performance-related metrics such as response time, throughput, scalability, and efficiency.

## Acknowledgement

The HotCloudPerf workshop is technically sponsored by the [Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation](https://spec.org/) (SPEC)’s [Research Group](https://research.spec.org/) (RG) and is organized annually by the [RG Cloud Group](https://research.spec.org/working-groups/rg-cloud/). HotCloudPerf has emerged from the series of yearly meetings organized by the RG Cloud Group, since 2013. The RG Cloud Group group is taking a broad approach, relevant for both academia and industry, to cloud benchmarking, quantitative evaluation, and experimental analysis.
