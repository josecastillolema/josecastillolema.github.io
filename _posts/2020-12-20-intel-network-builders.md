[Intel® Network Builders University](https://networkbuilders.intel.com/university) is a comprehensive network functions virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) training program. The university includes a broad collection of online content training to help technical professionals in the network industry to improve their knowledge of key Intel® technologies, industry trends, and technical aspects of NFV deployments.

I would like to recomend its courses to everyone who is interested in learning more about OpenStack, 4G, DPDK and Open vSwitch.

Intel proposes three learning paths:
