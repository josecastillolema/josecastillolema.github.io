[Red Hat Digital Credentials](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/digital-credential-program) recognize and reward learning achievements, community contributions and ecosystem engagement to drive the adoption of Red Hat technologies and to support customer success. A digital credential is earned upon meeting defined criteria, and Red Hat digital credentials can represent many types of achievements. A Red Hat digital badge is a sharable, verified, portable, data-rich form of that record.

After successfully passing a Red Hat Certification exam and updating your Red Hat account profile page to request a Red Hat Certification digital credential, you will receive an email notification directly from [Credly](https://www.youracclaim.com/organizations/red-hat-inc/badges) with instructions on how to accept and begin sharing your Red Hat digital badge. The acceptance of the Red Hat Certification digital badge is completely optional.

If your Red Hat Certification is current, Red Hat will retroactively issue a digital badge via Credly, which will be available and valid until the certification expires. If your Red Hat Certification expires, the digital badge will be updated to reflect this information.
