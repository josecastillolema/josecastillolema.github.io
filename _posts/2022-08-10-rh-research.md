## About

Red Hat Research connects Red Hat engineers with professors, researchers, and students to bring great research ideas into open source communities. Our activities around the world have produced grants from government and industry, papers at top conferences, and results that have landed in open source projects of all kinds. Red Hat Research welcomes participation from research-minded individuals around the world.

## Research Areas

The Red Hat Research Program emphasizes research projects (PhD dissertations, Master’s Theses, multi-partner government-funded collaborations) in key areas described below. However, we are always evaluating what the next interest area is based on what we’re hearing from our academic and industry partners and seeing in our own explorations:
 - [AI/ML](https://research.redhat.com/research-areas/ai-ml/)
 - [Cloud/DS](https://research.redhat.com/research-areas/cloud-ds/)
 - [Hardware and the OS](https://research.redhat.com/research-areas/hardware-and-the-os/)
 - [Security, Privacy, Cryptography](https://research.redhat.com/research-areas/security-privacy-cryptography/)
