Kick off of the [Horizon Europe CODECO](https://he-codeco.eu/) in the Munich Highlight Towers, on 16th and 17th of January 2023.

The CODECO project proposes a unique, smart, and cross-layer orchestration between the
decentralised data flow, computation, and networking services, to address Edge-Cloud
challenges derived from the rising Internet and IoT service decentralisation.
Coordinated by Fortiss and involving 15 relevant Edge-Cloud partners
across Europe, the project shall develop an ecosystem consisting of open-source toolkits,
large-scale experimentation, training tools and events, use-cases across 4 vertical domains
(Smart Cities, Energy, Manufacturing, Smart Buildings), multiple events integrated into a
unique Innovation and Research Community Engagement Programme.
