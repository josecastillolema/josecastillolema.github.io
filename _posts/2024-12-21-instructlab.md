I would like to recommend the [InstructLab: Democratizing AI Models at Scale](https://www.ibm.com/training/course/instructlab-democratizing-ai-models-at-scale-DL01001G) course which helps to understand InstructLab and its applications in customizing AI Language Models (SLMs and LLMs).

# Course Overview

Unlock the full potential of both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs) and transform your expertise into actionable insights. Have you ever felt that Language Models fall short in understanding your domain-specific knowledge? InstructLab bridges this gap, enabling you to contribute your expertise and enhance the model’s capabilities. This course will guide you through the process of democratizing AI with InstructLab, providing a deep dive into the underlying technology and hands-on tutorials to get you started. By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped to synthesize your domain specific data, fine-tune, align, and customize AI Language Models. Amplify your AI expertise, and earn a Credly digital badge to showcase your skills.
