## Open Networking Foundation
![](/assets/images/posts/2020-04-30-onf/0.jpg)

The [Open Networking Foundation (ONF)](https://opennetworking.org/) is a non-profit operator led consortium driving transformation of network infrastructure and carrier business models.

We are an open, collaborative, community of communities.  The ONF serves as the umbrella for a number of projects building solutions by leveraging network disaggregation, white box economics, open source software and software defined standards to revolutionize the carrier industry, including among others:

- [**Stratum**](https://opennetworking.org/stratum/): thin switch implementing next generation SDN interfaces.
 - [**Trellis**](https://opennetworking.org/trellis/): multi-purpose leaf-spine fabric supporting distributed access networks, NFV and edge cloud applications.
 - [**ODTN**](https://opennetworking.org/odtn/): open and disaggregated source data center interconnect solution.
 - [**SEBA**](https://opennetworking.org/seba/): lightweight platform that supports a multitude of virtualized access technologies at the edge of the carrier network, including PON, G.Fast and eventually DOCSIS and more.
 - [**SD-RAN**](https://opennetworking.org/sd-ran/): Complementary to the O-RAN architecture, it includes a near-real-time RIC (nRT-RIC) and a set of exemplar xApps for controlling the RAN.
 - [**Aether**](https://opennetworking.org/aether/): the first open source 5G Connected Edge platform for enabling enterprise digital transformation.
