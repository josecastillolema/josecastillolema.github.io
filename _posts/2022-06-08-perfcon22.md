## [Proceedings](https://perfconfspring2022.sched.com/)

[**MetalLB Perf&Scale Testing**](https://perfconfspring2022.sched.com/event/13Nri/metallb-perfscale-testing)

MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols (like BGP). For OCP 4.10, MetalLB speaker's implementation was reimplemented into FRR and support for BGP was added as a GA feature. In this talk, we will present the results of the MetalLB Perf&Scale testing report along with some tooling improvements to cope with this scenario.
