The [Open Source Community Day](https://www.eclipse.org/events/2025/oscd/), organised by the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org) in collaboration with [EUCloudEdgeIoT.eu](https://eucloudedgeiot.eu/), is a vibrant gathering of individuals united by a shared passion for open source software and technology. This event provides a unique opportunity for EU-funded projects to engage directly with the open source community—offering a space to connect, collaborate, and exchange ideas.

Whether you’re aiming to expand your skills, network with professionals, contribute to open-source initiatives, or simply meet like-minded peers, this day delivers a rich array of opportunities tailored to diverse goals and interests. It’s a platform for personal and professional growth, community building, and strengthening Europe’s open innovation ecosystem.

This event will gather open source contributors, researchers, developers, and innovators to connect and explore the future of digital technologies and collaborative development in the open source community. The event promises an engaging program filled with presentations, discussions, and networking opportunities.

As part of our dissemination and collaboration activities, we are hosting a community session where participants can show their ongoing research, open source initiatives, and project outcomes. This is a great opportunity to share your work with the broader community and foster new connections.

**MADRID | September 23-24, 2025**
