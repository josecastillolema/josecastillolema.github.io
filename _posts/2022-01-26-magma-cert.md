The purpose of the Magma certification test is to evaluate the technical abilities of engineers to deploy and operate [Magma](https://www.magmacore.org/). The test will consist of 25 questions that will test your knowledge of the three main Magma components: the access gateway, the Orc8r, and the network management system. During this test, you will be free to use all resources available to you. A score of 80% or higher is required to pass the test.

Prior to taking the test, you should have previously reviewed all documentation on the [Magma Docusaurus website](https://docs.magmacore.org/docs/next/basics/introduction.html) and the [Github repository](https://github.com/magma/magma). This includes reviewing the [Access Gateway Overview](https://magma.github.io/magma/docs/next/lte/architecture_overview) and Orc8r Overview subpages to understand the major services involved with Magma. These documents will be the primary sources for the information on the tests. Additionally, you should have installed an end to end test setup of Magma within your lab or working environment.
