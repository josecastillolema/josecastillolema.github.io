I would like to share my favourite way to prepare for some certifications. As you can see, I always do (1) the corresponding course and then jump to (2) practice exams. For the practice exams I heavily rely on [ExamTopics](/examtopics).

# AWS

 1. Do the corresponding [AWS Academy](/aws-academy) course
 2. Do the corresponding practice exam in the [AWS Skill Builder platform](/skillbuilder)
 3. Reviews/practice the corresponding tests from [ExamTopics](/examtopics), carefully reading the discussion forum for each question

---
**NOTE**

With [AWS Academy](/aws-academy) courses you earn 50% discount for all AWS certifications

# Azure/Microsoft

 1. Do the corresponding [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) course
 2. Reviews/practice the corresponding tests from [ExamTopics](/examtopics), carefully reading the discussion forum for each question

---
**NOTE**

Lots of opportunities for doing Azure exams for free:
 - [Microsoft Virtual Training Days](/azure-fundamentals)
 - [Microsoft Ignite Cloud Skills Challenge](/microsoft-ignite)

---

# Huawei

 1. Do the corresponding [Huawei Talent](/haina-talent) course
 2. Reviews/practice the corresponding tests from the [Huawei Talent](/haina-talent) platform itself
 3. As a complement, reviews/practice the corresponding tests from [ExamTopics](/examtopics), carefully reading the discussion forum for each question

---
**NOTE**

Lots of opportunities from the [Huawei ICT Academy program](/haina) for doing Huawei exams for free

---

# Red Hat

 1. Do the corresponding [Red Hat Learning Subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription) course

As all Red Hat exams are hands-on, and the [Red Hat Learning Subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription) course includes lots of labs, there is no need for additional material.
