Don't miss this virtual event sponsored by the ONF LATAM Ambassador team. In this webinar you will learn about the [Open Networking Foundation (ONF)](https://opennetworking.org/), a non-profit, operator-led consortium that is focused on driving transformation of network infrastructure and carrier business models around the world. The ONF serves as the umbrella for a number of projects building solutions for mobile and broadband operators by leveraging network disaggregation, white box economics and open source software to revolutionize the carrier industry.

With a robust community of operators, vendors and system integrators, ONF member companies have the opportunity to add their innovations and use cases to solutions that can be inserted into operator PoCs and trials, and be deployed into production networks.

Join us to learn about the exciting organization, its open source projects and how you can join and participate in the community.

This webinar will be delivered in Portuguese, Oct 23, 2020 10:00AM BRT. Register [here](https://onf.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_pJWEXMWASSqIPmDyZ9H9AQ).
