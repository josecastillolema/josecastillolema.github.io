## [Proceedings](https://perfconfall2021.sched.com/)

[**ICNI2 OVN Telco 5G perf/scale**](https://perfconfall2021.sched.com/event/nBpH/icni2-ovn-telco-5g-perfscale)

There has been an effort in the past months to test OVN Intelligent Container Network Interface 2 (ICNI2) implementations at scale. As part of the testing, [FRRouting](http://docs.frrouting.org/en/stable-8.0/) was used to simulate comercial load balancers and to establish BFD sessions with OVN. The ideia is to show how this was achieved and some control/data plane results of the experiments.
