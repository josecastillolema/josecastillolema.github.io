I would like to strongly recomend the [Kyverno Fundamentals Certification](https://learn.nirmata.com/courses/kyverno-fundamentals-certification) course for everyone interested in Kubernetes security.

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

This Kyverno Fundamentals Certification will test you the basic concepts of Kyverno, along with installation, policy definitions, results, and security.
