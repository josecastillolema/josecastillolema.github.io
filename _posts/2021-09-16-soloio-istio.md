# Get certified

Istio is the most popular service mesh deployed into production across the cloud-native ecosystem, and for good reason. Itâ€™s feature rich, open-source, and most importantly, battle proven. Istio provides the foundational pieces to implement zero-trust networking, get deeper observability into a distributed system, and smart routing control for safer software releases.

This certification is for those looking to learn more about how Istio works and how to operationalize it for their organization. You will learn the basics of routing, observability, and security, and then expand into leveraging Istio for a devops/gitops CI/CD flow, zero-downtime upgrades of Istio control plane, plugging in with existing PKI, and running Istio on VMs and across multiple clusters.

The [Essentials for Istio certification](https://www.solo.io/blog/get-certified-on-the-essentials-for-istio/) is based on a hands-on, instructor-led workshop focused on how to deploy Istio into production. You will have access to your own Linux virtual machine with a Kubernetes cluster and Istio to complete the exercises.

This credential, offered for free by Solo.io with [Credly](https://www.credly.com/), certifies that you possess the essential skills to deploy, configure, debug, secure, and operationalize Istio for your organization.
