## The project

The unstoppable proliferation of novel computing and sensing device technologies, and the ever-growing demand for data-intensive applications in the edge and cloud, are driving the next wave of transformation in computing systems architecture. The resulting paradigm shift in computing is centered around dynamic, intelligent and yet seamless interconnection of IoT, edge and cloud resources in one computing system, to form a continuum.

A continuum, today also referred to as cloud continuum, IoT continuum, edge-to-cloud or fog-to- cloud, is expected to provide the means for data processing both in the edge and cloud, while inferring and persisting important information for post-mortem and offline analysis. We envision a holistic approach towards the solutioning of this technology trend in future systems, by architecting, designing and implementing the continuum as extensible, open, secure, adaptable, AI-powered as well as well highly performant and technology agnostic, managed through a meta OS, i.e., **IoT2Cloud Operating System** (ICOS).

## Features

- Devices volatility and heterogeneity, continuum infrastructure virtualization and diverse network connectivity
- Optimized and scalable service execution and performance, as well as resources consumptions, including power consumption
- Guaranteed trust, security and privacy
- Reduction of integration costs and effective mitigation of cloud provider lock-in effects, in a data-driven system built upon the principles of openness, adaptability, data sharing and a future edge market scenario for services and data
