## About

[DevConf.CZ](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) is an annual, free, Red Hat sponsored community conference for developers, admins, DevOps engineers, testers, documentation writers and other contributors to open source technologies. At DevConf.CZ, FLOSS communities sync, share, and hack on upstream projects together.

DevConf.cz Mini is a bi-annual, highly focused, local, in-person version of DevConf.cz. It offers an opportunity to return to our conference themes in a smaller setting and establishes a platform for the Czech Republic and EMEA based community to sync, share and hack on upstream projects together.

There is no admission or ticket charge for DevConf.CZ events. However, you are required to complete a free registration. Watch this site for updates about registration.

We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment at our conference. We set expectations for inclusive behavior through our code of conduct and media policies, and are prepared to enforce these.

[**Writing a K8s Operator for Knative Functions**](https://devconfcz2023.sched.com/event/1MYpJ/writing-a-k8s-operator-for-knative-functions)

[![](/assets/images/posts/2023-05-23-devconf23/2.png)](https://research.redhat.com/blog/2023/06/09/red-hat-research-engineers-will-lead-the-workshop-on-k8s-operator-for-faas-at-devconf-cz-2023/)

Serverless and Function as a Service (FaaS) are getting more and more attention from customers and developers as a way to develop, run and manage applications functionality without the burden of infrastructure related knowledge. All big cloud providers offer them already, e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions or Microsoft Azure Functions. One of the most relevant upstream projects for serverless is Knative, which recently added support for functions (create, build, and deploy) on top of K8s clusters.

This workshop will introduce you to the the [PHYSICS European project](/physics) and its FaaS model, as well as to building Kubernetes operators. You will implement a K8s Operator, using the operatorsdk framework, to provide the functionality of the Knative CLI. This will allow easier creation, build and deployment of functions with Knative just by creating Kubernetes (CR) objects, and will help you learn the internals about how K8s Operators work in a real life example.

***Friday June 16, 2023 â€¢ 2:15pm - 3:35pm CEST***
